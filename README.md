## Syntax Glossaries

This references directory will provide a basic syntax glossary for each language taught at Treehouse. They are not designed to be a tutorial or to be instrunctional in anyway - the goal is to simply offer a quick and easy syntax reference with descriptive variable names for students to use during their coursework. Each listing in the glossary will link back to the coursework where the concept is taught and to any related practice sessions. Related listing will also be linked from each listing.

Glossaries currently available:

- [Javascript](https://github.com/treehouse/References/blob/master/javascript.md)


### Listing Format

The glossaries are written in markdown. The basic format is as follows:

```markdown
# array
```javascript
var myArray = [element1, element2, element3];
```

```javascript
var myArray = new Array();
```
